# Numpy and Pandas Exercises (Lab - 30.1.2025)

This repository contains solutions to the exercises on Numpy and Pandas, solving various tasks without using built-in functions. The exercises focus on matrix manipulations, statistical operations, and advanced indexing techniques.

## Exercises

### 1. Create a 1D and 2D Array using Numpy
- **Print the datatype, shape, and dimensions of the arrays**.

### 2. Create a 1D and 2D array with:
  - **i)** Random initialization
  - **ii)** Default initialization
  - **iii)** Print diagonal values
  - **iv)** Print the first element of the 2D array
  - **v)** Print the last element of the 2D array
  - **vi)** Print the 2nd row and 2nd column elements
  - **vii)** Print the number of elements in the array

### 3. Perform matrix operations on a 2D array:
  - Find the **determinant**, **addition**, **multiplication**, **subtraction**, **division**, **transpose**, **cross product**, and **dot product** of the matrix.

### 4. Print range values in 1D and 2D arrays.

### 5. Reshape an array into a different shape.

### 6. Find the following statistical operations:
  - **Minimum**, **Maximum**, **Sum**, **Mean**, **Median**, **Mode**, and **Standard Deviation** of the array.

### 7. Create a boolean mask for values greater than 5:
  - Use the mask to filter out values less than or equal to 5.
  - Count the number of values greater than 5.

### 8. Fancy Indexing:
  - Use fancy indexing to access elements at specific indices.
  - Create a new array by selecting every other element from the original array.

### 9. Structured Array:
  - Create a structured array to store information about students (name, age, grade).
  - Create a few sample students and access/modify specific fields of the structured array.

### 10. Linear Regression:
  - Using the following dataset:
    ```
    Study Hours (x₁)    Practice Tests (x₂)    Score (y)
    2                   1                       60
    3                   2                       65
    4                   2                       70
    5                   3                       75
    6                   3                       80
    ```
  - Find the **best-fit line** using simple linear regression without using functions.

## Requirements

To run the code, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas
